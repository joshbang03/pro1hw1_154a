Problem 1 and 2 work. Problem 3, I spent most the time figuring it out, but could not figure out how to get the 5 variable K map to work. I am still confused on how to efficiently solve the question.
I tried brute forcing the question and mapping out all 32 possible combinations. I quickly found that the gates were ridiculously long and tried to find a better way to solve it. 
I hand write every K-map and gate logic.
