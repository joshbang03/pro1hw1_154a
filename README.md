All problems work.
3 was very hard. I mapped out 32*7 possible outcomes (all 512 possible outcomes for k maps). I then realized I could pattern match the first four bits and use logic to do this by mapping the patterns to numbers(0-9) then I used logic to ensure appropiate values are assigned to the letters(A-G).
